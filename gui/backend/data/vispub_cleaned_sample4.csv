Vis,1990,A numerical method for rendering spherical reflections,10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146393,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146393,289,"297, 483-4",C,"Methods of rendering reflections in curved surfaces are examined. A numerical algorithm to derive spherical reflections is presented. This algorithm has many attractive qualities, such as low computation costs, object space coherence, device and resolution independence, and generation of maximum information about reflections in curved surfaces. The authors demonstrate that rendering reflections is a difficult problem, as it defies analytic solutions. The authors indicate several alternatives for generalizing this method to a broader domain.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;",David P. Dobkin;E. S. Panduranga;M. Zhu,D. Dobkin;E.S. Panduranga;M.

Vis,1990,Personal visualization system: applications in research and engineering,10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146418,443,"448, 490-1",C,"The authors describe an innovative personal visualization system and its application to several research and engineering problems. The system bridges both hardware and software components to permit a user to graphically describe a visualization problem to the computer; thereby reducing program development time to a few hours. Low-cost visualization is achieved using PC-based software that can either be executed on a PC or drive graphic workstations for high-resolution displays. In either case, supercomputer computation rates are available for the visualization process. On PCs this is done with one or more PiP plug in cards, each of which is capable of 100 million floating point operations per second. On workstations this is done with the QUEN array processor. Applications mentioned include: ocean wave imaging; characterizing superconductors; and solar sail visualization.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;",Quentin E. Dolecek;K. Moorjani;B. F. Kim;D. G. Tilley;Thomas S.

Vis,1991,How shall we connect our software tools?,10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175816,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175816,292,296,C,"Software tools are traditionally connected using human-readable files, an approach that buys flexibility and understandability at some cost in performance relative to binary file formats. The possibility of using shared-memory functions to retain most of the existing style while leapfrogging the speed of reading binary files, at least in some environments and for some applications, is explored. Results of a benchmarking experiment confirm the benefits of this alternative.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;",Eric Grosse,E. Grosse,"AT&T Bell Lab., Murray Hill, NJ, USA",,,0.0,0.0,4.0,,2,3
Vis,1991,Visualizing chemical kinetics in fractal domains,10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175831,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1991.175831,364,"367, 434",C,"Chemical reactions occurring within complex domains, such as fractals, can display behavior which differs radically from the expectation of classical chemical kinetics. Rather than relaxing to a uniform distribution at the steady state, these nonclassical systems display large-scale order on many scales. Such self-organization is difficult to measure using the usual statistical techniques, but is visually apparent. The authors discuss some of the problems of visualizing chemical kinetics in fractal domains and describe evolution of the visualization as the chemist and visualization scientist collaborated.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;",Neal E.
